# Assignment 1 Report

## KNN:
- My optimised model is the same as best model, I directly wrote vectorised code. To find out model without optimisation just replace all vectorisation with nested for loops.
- Was not able to run the whole code due to time constraints.
- Have written code to be run for all possible combinations of columns possible but have not run it (time constraints).
- For training the sklearn KNN model, I have used my best model's hyperparameters (k and distance metric)
- Have saved all the printed output in the output_log file, till where I was able to run before submitting the assignment.
